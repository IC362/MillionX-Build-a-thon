## 📌 Project Overview
Lavande's SmartTrack BI is an enterprise-grade AI engine designed specifically for the booming SME e-commerce sector in Bangladesh and beyond. It transforms fragmented transactional data into actionable growth strategies, acting as a "Virtual Chief Data Officer" for small merchants.

### The Role of this Dashboard
In an ecosystem dominated by intuition-based decisions, this dashboard bridges the intelligence gap by:
* **Democratizing Data:** Providing micro-merchants with insights previously reserved for giant retailers.
* **Optimizing Operations:** Automating complex tasks like price elasticity modeling and inventory forecasting.
* **Driving Financial Inclusion:** Turning transactional history into "Growth Signals" that can help SMEs prove creditworthiness to fintech partners like bKash.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Smart Demand Radar:** Predicts regional product trends using a blend of transactional data and social media chatter.
* **Dynamic Price Optimizer:** Suggests the "sweet spot" price for maximum margin based on real-time market signals.
* **Inventory Auto-Planner:** Proactively identifies stockout risks and suggests reorder timelines to prevent lost sales.
* **ROI Copilot:** A multilingual (Bangla/English) conversational interface that explains *why* an action is recommended.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The engine is built on a modular, plug-and-play framework:
1.  **Ingestion Layer:** Connectors for Shopify, Daraz, Pathao, and bKash.
2.  **Intelligence Core:** A hybrid pipeline of Time-Series models (Prophet/XGBoost) and LLMs for insight generation.
3.  **Action Engine:** Translates raw data into specific business nudges (e.g., "Restock 20 units of 'Silk Jamdani' before Friday").


## 🌍 Global Impact & Scalability
While launched in Bangladesh, the architecture is designed to scale across **South Asia, Africa, and LATAM**. By supporting local dialects and integrating with regional payment gateways, CommerceGPT aims to uplift SME productivity and contribute to significant GDP growth in emerging markets.
